  brand: Brand;
}
```
- Groups branches by brand
- Shows brand statistics and logos

### TableLayoutViewer Component
```typescript
interface TableLayoutViewerProps {
  branchId: string;
  layouts: Layout[];
}
```
- Interactive table grid visualization
- Multiple layout support

## Data Models

### Branch
```typescript
interface Branch {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  address: string;
  phone?: string;
  status: 'active' | 'inactive' | 'maintenance';
  tables_count: number;
  opening_hours?: string;
  manager?: {
    name: string;
    email: string;
    phone?: string;
  };
  brand: Brand;
  created_at: string;
}
```

### Brand
```typescript
interface Brand {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  description?: string;
  logo?: string;
  branches_count: number;
  branches: Branch[];
}
```

### MenuItem
```typescript
interface MenuItem {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  description: string;
  category: string;
  price: number;
  image?: string;
  status: 'active' | 'inactive';
  is_available_at_branch: boolean;
  branch_price?: number;
  dietary_info: string[];
  prep_time: string;
  rating: number;
}
```

## API Integration

### Directus SDK Usage

The system is designed to integrate with Directus using the full SDK:

```typescript
import { createDirectus, readItems } from '@directus/sdk';

const directus = createDirectus('https://your-directus-instance.com');

// Fetch brands with related branches
const brands = await directus.request(
  readItems('brands', {
    fields: ['*', { branches: ['*'] }],
    deep: { branches: { _filter: { status: { _eq: 'active' } } } }
  })
);
```

### Authentication

The system leverages the existing AuthContext for role-based access:

- **Administrator**: Full access to all branches and features
- **Manager**: Access to assigned branches only
- **Staff**: Limited access to assigned restaurant operations

## Performance Optimizations

### 1. Caching Strategy
- Service-level caching with TTL (Time To Live)
- Separate cache keys for different data types
- Cache invalidation on data updates
- Local storage for frequently accessed data

### 2. Lazy Loading
- Images loaded on scroll intersection
- Component-level code splitting
- Progressive data loading
- Skeleton screens for better UX

### 3. Bundle Optimization
- Dynamic imports for large components
- Tree shaking for unused dependencies
- Optimized image delivery with Next.js Image
- Minimal bundle size with careful dependency selection

## Error Handling

### Error Boundaries
- Component-level error catching
- Graceful fallbacks for failed loads
- User-friendly error messages
- Retry mechanisms for failed operations

### Network Error Handling
- Automatic retry with exponential backoff
- Offline detection and appropriate messaging
- Data validation and sanitization
- Fallback to cached data when available

## Security Considerations

### Access Control
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- Secure route protection
- API endpoint authorization
- Data filtering based on user permissions

### Data Validation
- Input sanitization on all forms
- Client-side and server-side validation
- XSS prevention measures
- CSRF protection implementation

## Mobile Responsiveness

### Breakpoints
- Mobile: 320px - 768px
- Tablet: 768px - 1024px
- Desktop: 1024px+

### Responsive Features
- Touch-friendly interactions
- Collapsible navigation on mobile
- Optimized table layouts for small screens
- Swipe gestures for menu navigation

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests
- Component testing with React Testing Library
- Service layer testing
- Utility function testing
- Error boundary testing

### Integration Tests
- API integration testing
- User flow testing
- Cross-component interaction testing
- Error scenario testing

### E2E Tests
- Complete user journey testing
- Mobile device testing
- Performance testing
- Accessibility testing

## Deployment

### Environment Variables
```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_DIRECTUS_URL=https://your-directus-instance.com
