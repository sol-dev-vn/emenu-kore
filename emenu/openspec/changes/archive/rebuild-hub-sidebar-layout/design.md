## Context
The current hub implementation uses a card-based grid layout which limits navigation scalability and doesn't provide a traditional admin interface experience. Restaurant staff need a more professional, efficient interface for daily operations.

## Goals / Non-Goals
- Goals: Create a scalable sidebar navigation, improve user experience, standardize admin interface
- Non-Goals: Complete backend rework, authentication changes, mobile app development

## Decisions
- Decision: Use standard sidebar navigation pattern instead of card grid
- Alternatives considered: Top navigation bar, tabbed interface, expanding menu sections
- Decision: Implement responsive sidebar that collapses on mobile
- Alternatives considered: Fixed sidebar always visible, mobile-only bottom navigation

## Risks / Trade-offs
- Risk: Breaking existing user workflows
- Mitigation: Keep all existing functionality, just reorganize navigation
- Trade-off: More complex routing structure vs improved navigation

## Migration Plan
1. Build new sidebar layout components
2. Migrate existing functionality to new structure
3. Update routing and navigation
4. Test and deploy

## Open Questions
- Should sidebar be collapsible or always visible on desktop?
- How to handle deep linking to specific sections?
