# Brand Menu Functionality - Development Plan Summary

## Overview
Comprehensive development plan to build real brand menu functionality that integrates with Directus database, replacing the current mock data implementation with full menu management capabilities.

### To: Dynamic Menu Management
- Real data from Directus `brand_menus`, `menu_items`, `menu_categories`
- Interactive category expansion and item display
