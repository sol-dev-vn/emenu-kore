# Branch Management System Design

## Architecture Overview

### Component Hierarchy
```
/hub/branches (main listing)
├── BrandGroupedList
│   └── BrandGroup (brand header + branch cards)
│       └── BranchCard (branch info + actions)
└── BranchDetailPage ([id] route)
    ├── BranchHeader (branch info + breadcrumbs)
    ├── TabbedContent
    │   ├── TableLayoutViewer (visual layout)
    │   ├── MenuManagement (menu items + toggles)
    │   └── BranchSettings (configuration)
```

### Data Flow
```
Directus API
├── brands (with related branches)
├── branches (with related layouts + brand_menus)
├── layouts (with related tables)
├── tables (with sessions)
├── brand_menus (master menu items)
├── menu_items (individual items)
└── branch_menu_items (per-branch selections)
```

## Technical Considerations

### State Management
- React Query for server state (brands, branches, layouts, menus)
- Local state for UI interactions (selected tab, search terms, toggles)
- Optimistic updates for menu item activation/deactivation

### Performance Optimizations
- Lazy loading for table layout visualizations
- Image optimization for branch thumbnails and menu item images
- Efficient relationship queries to minimize API calls
- Virtual scrolling for large branch lists

### User Experience
- Progressive disclosure: listing → details → specific management
- Consistent SOL brand styling (#9B1D20 red, #FFE4E1 background)
- Mobile-responsive design with touch-friendly interactions
- Clear visual hierarchy with proper spacing and typography

### Error Handling
- Graceful fallbacks for layout loading failures
- Clear error states with actionable messages
- Offline considerations for critical operations
- Validation for menu pricing and customizations

## Security & Access Control
- Leverages existing Directus RBAC system
- Role-based access: Administrator (all branches), Manager (assigned branches)
- Secure handling of branch-specific operations
- Audit trail for menu modifications
