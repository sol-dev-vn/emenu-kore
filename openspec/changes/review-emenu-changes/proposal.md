# Review and Deploy EMENU Changes

## Why
The emenu module has accumulated significant unstaged changes during development, including major UI/UX improvements (compact homepage design), bug fixes, and component updates. These changes need to be reviewed, tested, and deployed to maintain the development workflow and ensure the application remains stable and functional.

## What Changes
- **Homepage redesign**: Complete overhaul to compact, icon-based design fitting within single screen height
- **Mobile responsiveness**: Enhanced mobile-first design with proper touch interactions
- **QR scanner improvements**: Better camera handling and modal design for different screen sizes
- **Component updates**: Multiple UI components have been modified with improved styling and functionality
- **Server-side changes**: Dashboard and API updates for better data handling
- **Authentication improvements**: Login page enhancements and user experience improvements
- **Bug fixes**: Various bug fixes and performance optimizations
- **SOL branding**: Integration of SOL logo and brand color scheme throughout application

**BREAKING**: None - all changes are enhancements and bug fixes

## Impact
- Affected specs: emenu-core, emenu-ui, emenu-deployment
- Affected code: Frontend components, server functions, routing, authentication system
- Deployment changes: PM2 process management, build configuration updates
- Testing impact: Full regression testing required for responsive design and QR functionality

## Risk Assessment
- **Low Risk**: Changes are primarily UI/UX improvements and bug fixes
- **Testing Required**: Comprehensive testing of responsive design, QR scanner, and all routes
- **Rollback Plan**: Simple revert to previous working state if issues arise

## Deployment Notes
- **Svelte 5 Migration**: Fixed multiple Svelte 5 compatibility issues including:
  - Server-side import violations (changed to `import type` only)
  - Component prop conflicts (`class` → `cssClass`)
  - Dynamic component usage patterns (replaced with conditional rendering)
  - Form action updates for SSR compatibility
- **PM2 Configuration**:
  - Updated ecosystem config to use `.cjs` extension for CommonJS compatibility
  - Fixed package.json script paths
  - Application running on port 3520 in production mode
- **Build Process**: All builds complete successfully with only accessibility warnings (non-blocking)
- **Runtime Status**: Application deployed and operational with stable performance
