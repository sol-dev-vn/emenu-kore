## Dependencies and Prerequisites

### Technical Dependencies
- Next.js 15 with App Router
- Directus SDK for authentication
- Zod for form validation
- React Hook Form or similar for form management
- Lucide React for icons
- Tailwind CSS for styling

### External Dependencies
- Directus instance with user management configured
- Valid Directus API credentials
- HTTPS environment for production deployment
- Proper CORS configuration for Directus API

### Implementation Order Notes
1. **Critical Path**: Tasks 1-3 must be completed before UI work begins
2. **Parallel Work**: Tasks 4-6 can be developed simultaneously with 7-9
3. **Security Focus**: Tasks 10-11 should be completed before production deployment
4. **Testing**: Task 12 should be performed throughout development, not just at the end

## Validation Criteria
Each task should be considered complete when:
- [ ] Code is implemented and follows project conventions
- [ ] Tests are written and passing
- [ ] Code is reviewed for security vulnerabilities
- [ ] Documentation is updated
- [ ] Feature works on both desktop and mobile devices
- [ ] Accessibility requirements are met
- [ ] Integration with existing Directus instance is verified
