# Session Management Specification

## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Secure Session Storage
The system MUST store authentication tokens securely using HTTP-only cookies with appropriate security flags.

#### Scenario: Secure Cookie Configuration
Given a user successfully authenticates
When the system creates session cookies
Then the cookies are marked as HttpOnly
And the Secure flag is set for HTTPS environments
And the SameSite attribute is set to Strict
And appropriate expiration times are set for access and refresh tokens

#### Scenario: Token Storage Architecture
Given the system needs to manage authentication tokens
When a user logs in
Then the access token is stored in a short-lived cookie (15 minutes)
And the refresh token is stored in a longer-lived cookie (7 days)
And no tokens are stored in browser localStorage or sessionStorage
And token data is not exposed to client-side JavaScript

#### Scenario: Cookie Validation
Given the system receives a request with session cookies
When processing the request
Then the system validates cookie signatures
And checks cookie expiration times
And verifies cookie domain and path restrictions
And rejects malformed or tampered cookies

### Requirement: Automatic Token Refresh
The system MUST automatically refresh access tokens before they expire to maintain seamless user sessions.

#### Scenario: Proactive Token Refresh
Given a user has an active session with a valid refresh token
When the access token is approaching expiration (within 5 minutes)
Then the system automatically requests a new access token
And updates the access token cookie
And maintains the user's session without interruption
And does not require user interaction

#### Scenario: Silent Refresh Failure Handling
Given an automatic token refresh request fails
When the refresh token is invalid or expired
Then the system clears all authentication cookies
And redirects the user to the login page
And displays a message indicating the session has expired
And requires the user to authenticate again

#### Scenario: Concurrent Refresh Coordination
Given multiple simultaneous requests from the same user
When multiple requests attempt to refresh the token simultaneously
Then the system coordinates refresh attempts to prevent conflicts
And ensures only one refresh request is processed at a time
And caches the refreshed token for concurrent requests

### Requirement: Session Invalidation and Logout
The system MUST provide secure logout functionality and proper session invalidation.

#### Scenario: User-Initiated Logout
Given an authenticated user clicks the logout button
When the logout request is processed
Then the system invalidates the refresh token on the server
And clears all authentication cookies
And performs any necessary cleanup in Directus
And redirects the user to the login page

#### Scenario: Session Invalidation on Password Change
Given a user's password is changed in Directus
When they attempt to use existing session tokens
Then the system rejects the tokens as invalid
And forces the user to log in again with new credentials
And prevents session hijacking after password changes

#### Scenario: Multi-Device Session Management
Given a user is logged in on multiple devices
When they log out from one device
Then the system can optionally invalidate all sessions
Or invalidate only the current device session
Based on the chosen session management strategy

### Requirement: Middleware-Based Route Protection
The system MUST use Next.js middleware to protect routes and validate sessions efficiently.

#### Scenario: Route-Level Protection
Given an unauthenticated user attempts to access a protected route
When the middleware processes the request
Then it checks for valid session cookies
And validates the access token
And redirects unauthenticated users to the login page
And allows authenticated users to proceed

#### Scenario: Middleware Performance Optimization
Given the system needs to validate many requests
When processing route protection
Then the middleware uses efficient token validation
And caches validation results when appropriate
And minimizes database calls for session validation
And maintains high performance for protected routes

#### Scenario: API Route Authentication
Given a request to a protected API route
When the middleware processes the request
Then it validates the session cookie
And extracts user information from the token
And attaches user context to the request
And returns appropriate error responses for invalid sessions

### Requirement: Session Security and Monitoring
The system MUST implement session security measures and provide monitoring capabilities.

#### Scenario: Session Anomaly Detection
Given the system detects suspicious session activity
When anomalies are identified (multiple locations, unusual patterns)
Then the system can require additional authentication
Or invalidate suspicious sessions
And log security events for audit purposes

#### Scenario: Session Timeout Configuration
Given the system needs to balance security and usability
When configuring session timeouts
Then access tokens have short expiration (15 minutes)
And refresh tokens have reasonable expiration (7 days)
And idle sessions are automatically invalidated
And configuration can be adjusted per security requirements

#### Scenario: Session Audit Logging
Given security monitoring requirements
When authentication events occur
Then the system logs login attempts (success/failure)
And records logout events
And tracks session invalidation
And maintains audit trails for security analysis
