## Dependencies and Parallel Work

### Parallel Development Opportunities:
- Tasks 1.1, 1.2, 2.1 can be developed in parallel
- Tasks 3.1, 4.1, 5.1 can be worked on simultaneously by different developers
- Tasks 6.1, 6.2, 6.3, 7.1 can be developed concurrently
- Testing tasks (8.1, 8.2) can run in parallel with development

### Critical Dependencies:
- All authentication tasks (1.1-1.3) must be completed before hub functionality
- Loading animations (2.1-2.3) should be completed before UI implementation
- Branch selection (3.1) must be done before table management (4.x) and dashboard (5.x)
- QR scanner (6.1) depends on authentication system
- All features must be tested (Phase 8) before deployment

### Estimated Timeline:
- **Phase 1**: 3-4 weeks (Enhanced Authentication with Directus roles and UI layout)
- **Phase 2**: 3-4 weeks (UI/Animations, Bright Theme, and Flowbite Integration)
- **Phase 3-4**: 3-4 weeks (Hub Core + Table Management)
- **Phase 5-6**: 2-3 weeks (Dashboard + QR Features)
- **Phase 7**: 1-2 weeks (Menu Viewing)
- **Phase 8-9**: 2-3 weeks (Testing + Deployment)

**Total Estimated Duration**: 14-19 weeks

## Risk Mitigation:
- Authentication complexity: Start with basic email/password, add phone authentication later
- Real-time data challenges: Implement fallback to polling if WebSockets prove problematic
- Performance concerns: Implement progressive loading and caching strategies early
- Browser compatibility: Test early and often across target browsers
- User adoption: Involve restaurant staff in testing and feedback phases
