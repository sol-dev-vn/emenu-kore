## Claude Code AI Agent

**Claude Code CLI** with custom settings for GLM 4.6 LLM model ([Lite Coding Plan](https://docs.z.ai/devpack/overview) from [z.ai docs](https://docs.z.ai/scenario-example/develop-tools/claude))

Run `claude` in Terminal to enter the Claude Code environment.

To turn on auto-approve mode, run 

```sh
claude --dangerously-skip-permission
```

Use *Shift-Tab* to toggle between *Planning / Manual Approve / Auto Modes*.
Highly recommend starting with Planning mode when starting a new major task.
